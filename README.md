flat-theremin
=============

A musical instrument that tries to provide to it's user a similar interaction that you could have with a real theremin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin) in a two dimension surface (in a mobile or desktop screen). 

Using as it's base sound for audio generation a sine wave, user movement in the surface of the application generates changes on the speed and volume, changing the modulation of the wave sound. I've considered the idea around the project as a first step into synth construction.

The sound output of the instrument could be used along with and analogic or digital effects chains (outside or inside a computer) to generate different sounds or noises. Also with an external loop device, interesting sound samples can be created, maybe in a more sci-fi or robotic tradition.

After trying different approaches regarding graphics I've followed a minimalistic approach.
Based on my memories of oscilloscopes, I've tried to provide a graphic representation of our interaction over the sine wave, playing with the amplitude and the period of the wave in the graphic representation. 

Repetition and symmetry are present in the graphics, providing to the user a sense of depth with the superposed waves. 

The usage of white and faded colors try to provide a sense of ethereal simplicity, in dissonance with the sound that is produced by the instrument.
